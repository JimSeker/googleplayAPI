# Android Google Play API Demos

`legacy/` older examples that are no longer updated.

`fbDatabaseAuthDemo` Has multiple fragments to show firebase authentication, Google Authentication, Realtime Database (and firebase adapter for recyclerview), Storage, remote config, and invites (which sort of work).  There is code for notifications and analytics as well.

`firebaseFireStoreDemo` This uses firestore database instead of realtime and authentications to demo how the firestore db works.  You can have the same project with realtime and firestore. 

`FirebaseMessageDemo` is a start at an example for Cloud Messaging.  It works pretty well.   As of 9/17/24  ~The webcode needed is in the php directory of the project~, you will need a webserver to get this project running.  Google has updated to HTTP v1 API for the backend web services.  all the code will likely need to be rewritten.  I can't get the authorization to work in php, likely need to move to javascript code as firebase is not supported in php, which is the only way to authentication to send messages.
