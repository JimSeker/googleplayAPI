# Android Google Play API Demos

`legacy/` older examples that are no longer updated.

`fbDatabaseAuthDemo` Has multiple fragments to show firebase authentication, Google Authentication, Realtime Database (and firebase adapter for recyclerview), Storage, remote config, and invites (which sort of work).  There is code for notifications and analytics as well.

`firebaseFireStoreDemo` This uses firestore database instead of realtime and authentications to demo how the firestore db works.  You can have the same project with realtime and firestore. 

`FirebaseMessageDemo` is a start at an example for Cloud Messaging.  It works pretty well.  
There is also a javascript directory that is the back end system.  You will need node.js and mariadb (or change to what you want).  
You need create .env file and get the serviceAccount.json file from you google account [seek here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1)
