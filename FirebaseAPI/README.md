# Android Google Play API Demos

<b>legacy/</b> older examples that are no longer updated.

<b>fbDatabaseAuthDemo</b> Has multiple fragments to show firebase authentication, Google Authentication, Realtime Database (and firebase adapter for recyclerview), Storage, remote config, and invites (which sort of work).  There is code for notifications and analytics as well.

<b>firebaseFireStoreDemo</b> This uses firestore database instead of realtime and authenications to demo how the firestore db works.  You can have the same project with realtime and firestore. 

<b>FirebaseMessageDemo</b> is a start at an example for Cloud Messaging.  It works pretty well.  The webcode needed is in the php directory of the project, you will need a webserver to get this project running.


<b>MLFaceTrackerDemo</b> is the same as the FaceTracker2 and FaceTrackerMultiDemo in the visionAPI/, but is based on the ML  code.  Note this is firebase (cloud api), so you need to add to a project you own.  also note, the newer libraries are just broken (24.1.0) and there are bug reports dating back 6 months.   Note: the library is actually depreciated at this point.  so likely it will stop working too.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course and Cosc 4735 Advanced Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
