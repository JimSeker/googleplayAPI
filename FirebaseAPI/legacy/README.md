# Android Google Play API Demos

These are legacy projects and are no longer updated.

<b>firebaseMLKit</b> is a first attempt at using the firebase ML kit to do image recognition.  It's not the new ML kit, but the firebase cloud APIs. It's using mostly google example code at this point.  It has stopped working.  left as legacy.

`MLFaceTrackerDemo` is the same as the FaceTracker2 and FaceTrackerMultiDemo in the visionAPI/, but is based on the ML  code.  Note this is firebase (cloud api), so you need to add to a project you own.  also note, the newer libraries are just broken (24.1.0) and there are bug reports dating back 6 months.   Note: the library is actually depreciated at this point.  so likely it will stop working too.  Still works, but it set at API 30.
once gradle is updated, the app will no longer compile.  


These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course and Cosc 4735 Advanced Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
