# Android Google Play API ML KitDemos

This directory is specific to the on-device ML kit (not ML cloud) APIs  https://developers.google.com/ml-kit

`BarcodePicDemo` This example use an intent to take a picture and then processes the image for barcodes.  It should be able to recognize qr codes, but fails.

`DigitalInkRecDemo` is a simple example using the digital ink APIs, you draw/write letters/word and then see if it figure out the text.

`GoogleCodeScannerDemo` This example how to use the new bar code scanner.  this very quick and easy code and returns back the data  for you app to deal with.

`ImageLabelingDemo` This example how to use image labeling. it takes a picture and prints the object name it finds on the picture.

`mlkitFaceTrackerDemo` is a stripped down version of goggles examples to just do facetracking with a camera.  It's still very complex.

`MLkitTranslateTextDemo` is a very simple example using the translate APIs.

`DocumentScannerDemo` shows how to get the document scanner working. It's only set to one page and doesn't seem to work as well the website says.  but it does work.

`FaceMeshDemo` is simple example, that uses camera intent and then draw mesh on the face.  

`SelfieSegmentationDemo` is a simple example, that uses the camera intent, then draws over the background in pink, highlighting the "selfie".

`SubjectSegmentationDemo` is a simple example, that uses the camera intent, then draws over the subjects found to highlight them.  There is unused code to pull the subjects images as well.

`PoseDemo` This example of using the pose detection with the CameraX preview.  it has issues and is slow to start, but works okay.  They example is much faster and I've no clue why.

`TextRecPicDemo` This example use an intent to take a picture and then processes the image for Text Recognition APIs.
