# Android Google Play NearBy API

Note: these are using the functioning parts of NearBy, the older Nearby protocols that were depreciated have been removed.  Hopefully, these will continue to work (about as well as they always have at least).

`NearbyConnectionDemo` is simple example of using the Nearby Connection APIs.  It connects up between 2 devices and sends two messages.  It's still a little rough and needs much better comments.

`NearbyConStreamDemo` is an example of file passing to create a 4 fps video "stream" from one device to the other device.  It takes pictures and sends them.  

`legacy\` legacy code, that does not work anymore.
