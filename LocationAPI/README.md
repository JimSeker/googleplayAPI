#the play-services-location library: location, orientation, activity and sleep recognition APIs

`AcitivtyRecognition` is Google's example code from https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/tree/master/ActivityRecognition and will should likely be removed from this repo

`ActivityRecognitionDemo` uses the Activity Recognition API provide in the GooglePlay APIs.  This example show the most likely activity (and speech), plus any activities that "it" thinks are at least 50% likely.  

`ActMapDemo` combines LocationAware, ActivityRecognition, and Google Maps together in an example where it use the location to draw on a map the path the user is going.  The line changes color to show the different activities (ie walking, running, driving, etc).  A key is needed on the map for the colors though.

`FusedOrientationDemo`  (java) simple demo of the FusedOrientation APIs

`FusedOrientationDemo_kt`  (kotlin) simple demo of the FusedOrientation APIs

`LocationAwareDemo` (java) shows how to use FusedLocation APIs to do location better then standard GPS demos.  plus will show the likely address of your location.

`LocationAwareDemo_kt` (kotlin) shows how to use FusedLocation APIs to do location better then standard GPS demos.  plus will show the likely address of your location.

`SleepAPIDemo` is a simple example of a use the Sleep API from the recognition APIs
