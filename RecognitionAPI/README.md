# Android Google Play API, Activity Recognition APIs.


<b>ActMapDemo</b> combines LocationAware, ActivityRecognition, and Google Maps together in an example where it use the location to draw on a map the path the user is going.  The line changes color to show the different activities (ie walking, running, driving, etc).  A key is needed on the map for the colors though.

<b>AcitivtyRecognition</b> is Google's example code from https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/tree/master/ActivityRecognition and will should likely be removed from this repo

<b>ActivityRecognitionDemo</b> uses the Activity Recognition API provide in the GooglePlay APIs.  This example show the most likely activity (and speech), plus any activities that "it" thinks are at least 50% likely.  

<b>SleepAPIDemo</b> is a simple example of a use the Sleep API from the recognition APIs
