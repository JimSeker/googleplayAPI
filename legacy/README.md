# Android Google Play API Demos

These are legacy projects and are no longer updated.

`CouldMessageDemo` is a start at an example for Google Cloud Messaging (GCM).  It sort of works.  You will need to register it your google API to use it. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gradle-appengine-templates/tree/master/GcmEndpoints  There are multiple problems.  There is code in mainActivity that is deprecated code and GCM is also deprecated for the new Firebase Cloud messaging.  So basically I've stopped work on this example and hope to replace it with firebase version at some point.


`FitDemo` Currently demo's the Sensor APIs of Google Fit. This is example is based on https://github.com/googlesamples/android-fit, https://github.com/android/fit-samples   Note you will need a key to run this demo, see https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-api-key#release-cert to create one you can use.  The API is now deprecated, starting May 2024 no new sign upare are allowed.
